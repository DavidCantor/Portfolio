    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
      I am a Junior Full Stack Developer with a stronger focus on Nuxt (SSR) for frontend
      and Django for backend development.
      <br /><br />
      I work with clean architecture, readable code, and end-to-end responsibility —
      from idea to deployment.
      <br /><br />
      I also understand business and accounting processes, which helps me build software
      aligned with real operational needs.
